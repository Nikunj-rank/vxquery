XMark
=====

# Description

The original XMark queries and data generation are available at http://www.xml-benchmark.org/downloads.html, 
with the queries being viewable online at http://www.ins.cwi.nl/projects/xmark/Assets/xmlquery.txt. In the
query folder, we have separate query files singling out the exact syntax for the versions of these queries 
used in our VXQuery work with XMark; the differences are due to the way we have physically organized the 
XMark data for storage/parallelism reasons.
